## The function makeCacheMatrix will create a 'special' matrix object
## that will be able to cache within itself its own inverse for 
## efficiency

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
